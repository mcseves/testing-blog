Hello, my name is Maria Carolina. Iâ€™m a Brazilian and Portuguese lady with a bachelor in Computer Engineering and an aptitude for design. My hobbies revolve around baking goods and reading.

My goal in life is to provide customers with an excellent experience! Currently, I'm studying User Experience Design and LCC.

Before that, I worked at IBM as a UX consultant, creating personalized customer journeys using virtual assistants for one of the Brazilian biggest carriers. I was responsible for creating user flows for recharging prepaid phones, changing mobile plans, consulting balance of prepaid phones, and more.
